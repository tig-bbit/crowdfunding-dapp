# Crowdfunding D-app

The crowdfunding web3 full-stack app is a decentralized fundraising platform that leverages blockchain technology to revolutionize the way projects and initiatives are funded. It allows individuals and organizations to create campaigns and raise funds from a global network of contributors, all while ensuring transparency, security, and immutability of transactions.

On the front-end, the app provides an intuitive user interface where project creators can create and customize their fundraising campaigns. Users can browse through various projects, view project details, and make contributions using cryptocurrency wallets integrated with the app.

The back-end of the app utilizes smart contracts deployed on a blockchain network, such as Ethereum. These smart contracts govern the rules and logic of the crowdfunding process, handling tasks such as accepting contributions, tracking funding progress, and enforcing campaign milestones.
